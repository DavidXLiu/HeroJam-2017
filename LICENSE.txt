The following project utilizes a shader script that was originally created by AnomalousUnderdog.
The script, which is a variant of the original Outlind Diffuse 3 script, can be found here: http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/Silhouette-Outlined_Diffuse
The use of this script is for the selection of the "human characters" in the game.
